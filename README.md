[Cory Lanou] Making a RESTful JSON API in Go

Grab the article at [https://thenewstack.io/make-a-restful-json-api-go/](https://thenewstack.io/make-a-restful-json-api-go/)

## Tips/Run

* At CLI run "go run main.go" to serve at localhost:8080
* I'm still a little confused by the closing of the function not being required, including it results in "exported function Index should have comment or be unexported" (will investigate and learn)
* There's an alternative router in the form of [mux](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/mux) from the [Gorilla Web Toolkit](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/)

## What's it all about?

* ..."we will not only cover how to use Go to create a RESTful JSON API, but we will also talk about good RESTful design"...

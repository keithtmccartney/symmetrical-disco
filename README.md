[Cory Lanou] Making a RESTful JSON API in Go

## Tips/Run

* At CLI run "go run main.go" to serve at localhost:8080
* I'm still a little confused by the closing of the function not being required, including it results in "exported function Index should have comment or be unexported" (will investigate and learn)
* There's an alternative router in the form of [mux](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/mux) from the [Gorilla Web Toolkit](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/)
* There's 'ToDo' routing in place, accessible via "go run main.go", followed by the example localhost:8080 URLs: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080); [http://localhost:8080/todos](http://localhost:8080/todos); [http://localhost:8080/todos/1](http://localhost:8080/todos/1); [http://localhost:8080/todos/2](http://localhost:8080/todos/2); [http://localhost:8080/todos/3](http://localhost:8080/todos/3);

## What's it all about?

* ..."we will not only cover how to use Go to create a RESTful JSON API, but we will also talk about good RESTful design"...
